        <p class="intro">
            Natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, cyclones, and wildfires
            can cause serious harm to lives, homes, and communities. Many disasters
            occur without warning, making awareness and preparedness essential
            for everyone.
        </p>

        <p class="community">
            This platform is built to educate people about disaster risks and to
            bring communities together. By sharing knowledge, preparedness tips,
            and support, we can reduce loss of life and property and help each
            other stay safe during emergencies.

        <h2>About Natural Disasters</h2>

        <p>
            Natural disasters are extreme events caused by natural processes of
            the Earth. These events can occur suddenly or develop over time and
            often result in serious damage to lives, property, and the environment.
        </p>

        <p>
            Common natural disasters include earthquakes, floods, cyclones,
            tsunamis, landslides, droughts, and wildfires. Each type of disaster
            has different causes and effects, but all of them pose significant
            risks to human safety.
        </p>

        <p>
            Understanding how natural disasters occur helps people recognize
            warning signs and take early action. Knowledge about disaster risks
            allows individuals and communities to prepare emergency plans, build
            safer environments, and respond effectively during emergencies.
        </p>

        <p>
            This platform aims to spread awareness and accurate information so
            that communities can reduce losses and recover faster after disasters.
            When people are informed and connected, they become stronger and more
            resilient together.

            <h3>Earthquake</h3>
            <p>
                An earthquake occurs when sudden movements in the Earth's crust release
                energy, causing the ground to shake. Strong earthquakes can damage buildings,
                roads, and put lives at risk.

            <h3>Tsunami</h3>
            <p>
                A tsunami is a series of powerful ocean waves usually caused by underwater
                earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. These waves can flood coastal areas
                and cause widespread destruction.

            <h3>Volcanic Eruption</h3>
            <p>
                Volcanic eruptions occur when magma, ash, and gases escape from beneath
                the Earth's surface. Eruptions can destroy nearby land and affect air quality.

            <p>
                Floods happen when heavy rainfall or rising water levels overflow onto
                land. Flooding can damage homes, crops, and disrupt daily life.

            <h3>Tornado</h3>
            <p>
                A tornado is a rapidly rotating column of air that extends from a storm
                cloud to the ground. Tornadoes are extremely dangerous and can destroy
                everything in their path.

            <h3>Landslide</h3>
            <p>
                Landslides occur when large amounts of soil, rocks, or debris move down
                a slope. Heavy rain or earthquakes often trigger landslides in hilly areas.

                Wildfires are uncontrolled fires that spread quickly through forests
