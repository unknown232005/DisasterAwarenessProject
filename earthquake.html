    <h2>About Earthquakes</h2>
    <p>
        Earthquakes are sudden shaking of the ground caused by movements in the Earth's crust. They release seismic energy that can damage buildings, roads, and other infrastructure.
        Major earthquakes can lead to aftershocks, tsunamis, and landslides.
